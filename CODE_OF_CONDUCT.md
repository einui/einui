# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (doxing)

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it. You can report incidents by:

- Opening an issue and choosing the subject `code-of-conduct` (maintainers will handle reports privately), or
- Contacting the maintainers directly via their GitHub accounts (for this repository: @ehsanghaffar)

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will remain confidential to the degree possible.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team, who will determine appropriate and fair responses, which may include temporary or permanent bans from the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.md
