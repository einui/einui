# Security Policy

We take security reports seriously. Please follow the steps below to report a security vulnerability.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preferred method: Use **GitHub Security Advisories** for confidential reports: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories

If you don't have access to Security Advisories, you may:

- Open an issue with the title **Security vulnerability report** and mark it as private, or
- Contact the maintainers directly via their GitHub accounts (for this repository: @ehsanghaffar)

When reporting, please include:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (or a proof-of-concept) and the affected versions
- Any remediation or mitigation suggestions

## Response

We aim to respond to security reports within 5 business days and will coordinate a fix and timeline with the reporter. We will follow responsible disclosure best practices and will credit reporters as agreed.

## Supported Versions

List which versions are actively supported and monitored for security issues (e.g., `main` and releases since `v1.0.0`). If unsure, the maintainers will clarify in the security advisory.
